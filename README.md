# pandas-challenge

Contributor: Thomas Keene

Overview:
In this project, I performed an analysis of the PyCity schools based on district-wide standardized test results. I combined the data for students and schools into a single dataset, then analyzed the aggregated dataset to observe trends based on school budgets, school sizes, and school types. I used Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis, along with Visual Studio Code. The results can be found in the File titled "PyCitySchools.ipynb" in the Folder titled "PyCitySchools".
